\section{Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 3D feature map, }{


Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 3D feature map,
e.g., the \eqn{j}-th channel of the \eqn{i}-th sample in the
batched input is a 3D tensor \eqn{\text{input}[i, j]}) of the input tensor).
Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call with
probability \code{p} using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.\preformatted{See `~torch.nn.Dropout3d` for details.
