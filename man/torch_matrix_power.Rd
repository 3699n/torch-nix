\item{input}{(Tensor) the input tensor.}

}
\description{
matrix_power(input, n) -> Tensor
}
\details{
Returns the matrix raised to the power :attr:\code{n} for square matrices.
For batch of matrices, each individual matrix is raised to the power :attr:\code{n}.

If :attr:\code{n} is negative, then the inverse of the matrix (if invertible) is
raised to the power :attr:\code{n}.  For a batch of matrices, the batched inverse
(if invertible) is raised to the power :attr:\code{n}. If :attr:\code{n} is 0, then an identity matrix
is returned.
