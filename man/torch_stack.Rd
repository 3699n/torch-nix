\title{Stack}
\arguments{
\item{tensors}{(sequence of Tensors) sequence of tensors to concatenate}

\item{dim}{(int) dimension to insert. Has to be between 0 and the number        of dimensions of concatenated tensors (inclusive)}

\item{out}{(Tensor, optional) the output tensor.}
}
\description{
stack(tensors, dim=0, out=None) -> Tensor
}
\details{
Concatenates sequence of tensors along a new dimension.

All tensors need to be of the same size.
