\title{Split}
\description{
Splits the tensor into chunks.
}
\details{
\preformatted{If :attr:`split_size_or_sections` is an integer type, then :attr:`tensor` will
be split into equally sized chunks (if possible). Last chunk will be smaller if
the tensor size along the given dimension :attr:`dim` is not divisible by
:attr:`split_size`.

If :attr:`split_size_or_sections` is a list, then :attr:`tensor` will be split
into ``len(split_size_or_sections)`` chunks with sizes in :attr:`dim` according
to :attr:`split_size_or_sections`.

Arguments:
    tensor (Tensor): tensor to split.
    split_size_or_sections (int) or (list(int)): size of a single chunk or
        list of sizes for each chunk
    dim (int): dimension along which to split the tensor.
}
