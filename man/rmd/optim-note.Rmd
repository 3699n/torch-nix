# Warning

If you need to move a model to GPU via `$cuda()`, please do so before constructing optimizers for it. Parameters of a model after `$cuda()` will be different objects with those before the call.
In general, you should make sure that optimized parameters live in consistent locations when optimizers are constructed and used.
