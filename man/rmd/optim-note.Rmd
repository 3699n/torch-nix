# Warning

If you need to move a model to GPU via `$cuda()`, please do so before constructing optimizers for it. Parameters of a model after `$cuda()` will be different objects from those before the call.
In general, you should make sure that optimized parameters are the same objects when optimizers are constructed and when they are used.
